This benchmark combines:

* [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)
* [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
* [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino)

The goal is to test the performance of the Java Stream API before
and after the "stream fusion" optimization, and then compare the results.
Intermediate artifacts are available in this
[`summary.html`](https://www.objectionary.com/benchmark/summary.html).
We partially reuse the benchmark suggested by
[Biboudis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6631)
([sources](https://github.com/biboudis/clashofthelambdas))
and used by
[MÃ¸ller et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3428236).

This is the summary of the tests performed
by openjdk 23.0.2,
on 2025-07-26
at 17:58,
on Linux with 4 CPUs,
in [this GHA run][benchmark-gha]
(the numbers are in milliseconds):

| Test method | Before | After | Diff | Gain |
| --- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| [`Big.plain`](https://github.com/objectionary/benchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eolang/benchmark/Big.java) | `45.67` | `45.76` | `+0.09` | `+0%` |
| [`Big.streams`](https://github.com/objectionary/benchmark/blob/master/src/main/java/org/eolang/benchmark/Big.java) | `167.86` | `48.13` | `-119.73` | `+71%` |

The entire test took 113 seconds.
