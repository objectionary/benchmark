It's a benchmark that puts together:

  * [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)
  * [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
  * [eo-phi-normalizer](https://github.com/objectionary/eo-phi-normalizer)

The goal is to test the performance of Java code before optimization and after,
then comparing the results. Intermediate artifacts are in this 
[`summary.html`](https://www.objectionary.com/benchmark/summary.html).

<!-- benchmark -->
This is the summary of the tests performed with the TOTAL set to 1000000, at 2024-01-30 10:52, on Linux, with 4 CPUs:

| | Before | After | Diff |
| --- | --: | --: | --: |
| Time, msec (with JIT, Ã—40 cycles) | 2128 | 1435 | -32% |
| Time, msec (no JIT) | 2239 | 948 | -57% |
| Total `.class` files | 2 | 3 | |
| Bytes in all `.class` files | 5593 | 5495 | |
| JAR file size, bytes | 5067 | 5227 | |

This table is updated on every successful run of the [make](https://github.com/objectionary/benchmark/actions/workflows/make.yml) job of GitHub Actions.
