This benchmark combines:

* [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)
* [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
* [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino)

The goal is to test the performance of the Java Stream API before
and after the "stream fusion" optimization, and then compare the results.
Intermediate artifacts are available in this
[`summary.html`](https://www.objectionary.com/benchmark/summary.html).
We partially reuse the benchmark suggested by
[Biboudis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6631)
([sources](https://github.com/biboudis/clashofthelambdas))
and used by
[MÃ¸ller et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3428236).
