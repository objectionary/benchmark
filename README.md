It's a benchmark that puts together:

  * [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
  * [opeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/opeo-maven-plugin)
  * [ineo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/ineo-maven-plugin)

The goal is to test the performance of Java code before optimization and after,
then comparing the results. Intermediate artifacts are in this 
[`summary.html`](https://www.objectionary.com/benchmark/summary.html).
