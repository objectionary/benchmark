This benchmark combines:

* [eo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/eo)
* [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
* [phino](https://github.com/objectionary/phino)

The goal is to test the performance of the Java Stream API before
and after the "stream fusion" optimization, and then compare the results.
Intermediate artifacts are available in this
[`summary.html`](https://www.objectionary.com/benchmark/summary.html).
We partially reuse the benchmark suggested by
[Biboudis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6631)
([sources](https://github.com/biboudis/clashofthelambdas))
and used by
[MÃ¸ller et al.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3428236).

Important numbers are in the "Gain" and "Ratio" columns.
Empty cells in the "Gain" column mean that the performance
did not change significantly, while the "Ratio" column
shows how many times the performance improved
after the optimization.
