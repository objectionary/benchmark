It's a benchmark that puts together:

  * [jeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/jeo-maven-plugin)
  * [opeo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/opeo-maven-plugin)
  * [ineo-maven-plugin](https://github.com/objectionary/ineo-maven-plugin)

The goal is to test the performance of Java code before optimization and after,
then comparing the results.

This is the results obtained most recently:

<!-- benchmark -->
| | Seconds |
| --- | --: |
| Before optimization | 2.96 |
| After optimization | 2.96 |
